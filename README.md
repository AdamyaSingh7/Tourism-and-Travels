# Tourism-and-Travels
 Built a tool to show the interconnectivity of tourist places and find the minimum time path from a given hotel for Tourism and Travels by using data structures like graphs and algorithms

**INTRODUCTION**
Tourism and Travel App  is a project in C++ that can help you understand the concepts of advance data structures, file handling and functions. This application will teach you how to add, list, modify or edit, search and delete data to/from an application .Adding new records, listing them, modifying them and updating new places for available to go for server.  And search for places on user based criteria that can be handled with the help of data structures such as linked list, stack, trees etc . Information such as terrain, price, weather, food recommendation can also be asked. Additionally, these records can then be modified, listed, searched for and removed by server using various algorithms such as searching sorting to provide user seamless and user friendly experience when managing contacts. 

**FEATURES:-**
The following system has been designed to computerize the following functions that are performed by the system: 
Adding new places (for server): 
Add new places with details such as name, cost per person, and much more. 
Display:-
Displaying tourist attraction and hotels and details about hotels like price per night
Distance from airport,Rating and description about tourist attraction.
Searching: 
Search for places by name of city. 
Searching and showing travel packages. 

**DATA STRUCTURES AND TOOLS USED:-**
a. Linked Lists: - Linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes.Linked can be of multiple types: singly,double,multi linked list. They are used to overcome the shortcoming of arrays in operations such as insertion, deletion,etc. 
b. Graph: - Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. They are used to represent networks, which may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. 

**USER INTERFACE:-** 
-	Designing a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction. 
-	Provide clear menu options and commands for performing various operations.
